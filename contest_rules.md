# Contest Rules for the IBM Quantum Developer Conference Coding Challenges

Welcome to the IBM Quantum Developer Conference (QDC)!

The spirit of this year’s coding competition is to push the boundaries of applied quantum computing; finding clever ways to achieve better scientific results within the scope of recent, impactful work from the community. The IBM team, in conjunction with our partners, has devised a suite of challenges designed to test your quantum skills using Qiskit, and the IBM Quantum platform.

Please review the following rules carefully to ensure a smooth competition experience.


## 1. General Rules
1. The contest is open to all registered participants of the IBM Quantum Developer Conference, excluding IBM employees. IBM employees are not permitted to participate in the challenges and are ineligible to receive awards. Participants must register and attend the conference in person to compete.
2. Participants must bring their own laptops and any necessary equipment to take part in the coding challenges. Access to IBM Quantum and Qiskit tools will be provided via the IBM Quantum platform.
3. Participation will take place in teams, which will be assigned randomly.
4. Each team will be designated a specific challenge track for the competition, consisting of four notebook-based challenges. While participants are free to explore all challenges, including those outside their assigned track, only results submitted for their designated track will be considered. As the challenges require significant time to complete, teams are encouraged to focus on their assigned track.
5. The competition requires the use of the Python programming language, the Qiskit SDK, and the IBM Quantum platform. Participants must utilize the tools and software features introduced during the seminars but are encouraged to explore creative ways of combining them to achieve improved results.
6. All participants are expected to compete with fairness and respect. Any form of cheating, tampering with another team’s work, or using unauthorized external assistance is strictly prohibited and may result in disqualification. Additionally, attempting to solve the challenges in ways that defeat the purpose or spirit of the event will result in the submission being nullified and the team disqualified.
7. Participants must not share or publish their solutions during the conference. Once the contest concludes, participants are welcome to discuss their approaches and solutions freely.


## 2. Structure
1. The competition spans three days and consists of two tracks — Track A and Track B — each comprising four challenge notebooks.
2. Participants will have access to all four challenges in their assigned track from the start of the event, and may submit their solutions between 16:00 on the first day and 13:00 on the final day.
3. Teams are free to self-organize their work as they see fit — for example, by parallelizing challenge resolution or collaborating on the same task simultaneously.
4. On the final day, participants will also have the opportunity to explore a series of tutorials showcasing many of the new features announced during the event.


## 3. Challenge Submission, Scoring & Awards
1. Each challenge will be auto-graded based on predefined criteria on a scale of up to 100 points. Participants must submit their solutions using the grading system embedded within the provided Jupyter notebooks.
2. Each challenge is expected to require approximately 10 minutes of QPU time to run the canonical solutions devised by the challenge developers. Participants are encouraged to use their allocated time wisely — exceeding 30 minutes per notebook may lower your execution priority in the queue and make it difficult to complete further runs. Priority will be computed per team.
3. A live leaderboard will display the full ranking of all teams based on their auto-graded scores, both overall and per challenge. The leaderboard will be publicly visible throughout the conference, granting highest-ranking teams visibility and recognition for their performance throughout the event.
4. In the event of a tie in scores, the participant or team that submitted their solution earlier will be ranked higher.
5. All submissions must be completed by 13:00 on Day 3. Late submissions will not be accepted.
6. The top submissions for each challenge will be reviewed by an expert panel to verify compliance with the rules and assess overall quality. Participants must retain all evidence and code used to generate their solutions.
7. The team with the highest total score across all four challenges in their track (400 points in total) by the end of the competition will be declared the winner of that track. Each member of the winning team will receive a commemorative plaque recognizing their achievement.


## 4. Disqualification

Any disputes must be submitted to the event organizers no later than one hour after the end of the solution submission window. The decision of the expert panel will be final and binding.

Participants may be disqualified for any of the following reasons:
1. Submitting plagiarized solutions.
2. Using unauthorized methods, such as classical brute-force algorithms. Acceptable submissions should be generalizable (i.e., able to solve similar problems instances), must not rely on prior knowledge of the optimal solution, and must demonstrate significant use of quantum computing capabilities.
3. Tampering with the auto-grader or attempting to manipulate it to falsely pass tests.
4. Violating the code of conduct, including any form of cheating, tampering with others’ submissions, or disruptive behavior.

In the event of disqualification, the participant or team will be removed from the leaderboard, and the next highest-ranking team or participant will assume their position, subject to the same validation process.


## 5. Miscellaneous
1. All code and solutions submitted during the competition will remain the intellectual property of the respective participants or teams.
2. By participating, entrants agree that IBM may showcase and use anonymized submissions for educational, research, and promotional purposes.
3. Any technical issues should be reported to the event organizers immediately. While every effort will be made to resolve such issues, IBM is not responsible for delays or disruptions resulting from technical difficulties.
4. IBM reserves the right to modify the rules or structure of the competition if necessary to ensure fairness and integrity.
